# Xcode_CardsProject_DashBoard
A card app created with Swift and UIKit using Storyboards. Cards change randomly until the 'Stop' button is pressed. The 'Reset' button restarts the card rotation. The purpose was to learn interface creation using Storyboards and compare it with pure code-based approaches.
